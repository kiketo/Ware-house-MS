Create a kanban board with the following data, fill it and keep it updated:

Name of Feature
Feature Owner (who will write it?)
Estimated time it would take (in hours, don't overthink it)
Actual time it took (in hours)
Estimated time it would take to unit test (in hours)
Actual time it took to unit test (in hours)


For the board you could use Trello or GitLab's project system.

If your selected tool does not support time estimation (for example Trello), just write it in the card's description or use an addon.
